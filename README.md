# Weather Forecast App
This project is part of "The Odin Project" curriculum and serves as an introduction to utilizing APIs. The goal of this project is to create a weather forecast site that provides weather information for a specified location. The weather data is fetched using the weather API covered in the previous lesson. The app should allow users to search for a particular location and switch between displaying the temperature in Fahrenheit or Celsius.


## Features
- Location Search: Users can input a specific location to retrieve its weather forecast.
- Temperature Conversion: Users can toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius to view temperature data in their preferred unit.
- Dynamic Page Styling: The appearance of the page changes based on the weather data. This could involve altering the background color or incorporating weather-related images.
- GIF Integration: To enhance the user experience, the app can leverage the Giphy API to find and display weather-related GIFs that correspond to the current weather conditions.
- Promise and Async/Await Usage: The project encourages the use of asynchronous programming techniques, allowing you to choose between using Promises or async/await for handling API requests.


## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Weather API (used to fetch weather data)
- Giphy API (optional, for displaying weather-related GIFs)


## Learning Objectives
Through this project, i will gain hands-on experience with the following concepts:

- Making API requests to fetch data.
- Asynchronous programming using Promises and/or async/await.
- Dynamically updating the DOM based on retrieved data.
- Enhancing user experience through dynamic styling and visual elements.
- Integrating external APIs (optional) to supplement the project functionality.
